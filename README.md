# Importing Files from learn.codethedream.org

Clone and npm install.

To import files, first create a file where each line contains the slug
of the file to be imported.

Then run node <path>/index.mjs <fn> where the <path> is where
you cloned this repo and the fn is the path of the file with
the list of slugs.  It creates the md files in the current working directory.
